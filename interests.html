        <h2> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rhythm games</h2>
        <p>
          Started as a kid with games such as Guitar Hero and Rockstar. <br> Had the accompanying drum kit/guitar combo, and loved the feel of playing "instruments" alongside great songs.</p>
        <p>
          Eventually some of my friends started playing an online rhythm games much similar to Guitar Hero and the likes. 
          <br> With the main difference being what you used as an "instrument" which was now your computer keyboard, these games were now much more accessible for people. 
          <br> 
        </p>
        <p>
          Picture above is a "BMS controller" for the rhythm game "Beatoraja" or "BMS" for short, also known as "Beatmania", "Lunatic Rave 2" or "IIDX".

        <h2>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Music &amp; Piano </h2>
        <p>
          Though the image above is that of a piano, my first instrument was, 
          as im sure it was for many other people a flute. 
          <br> Great flute, still have it at home! <br> Eventually I managed to get my hands on a guitar at home as well as a midi piano.</p>
        <p>
          I sadly never got very far in either instrument, only mainly learnt how to play "Here comes the sun" by the beatles at home for fun. 
          <br> Didn't get much further on the piano either, had a great time on both instruments though! 
          <br> Recently been meaning to get back into it, mainly the piano.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music production and making your own songs from "scratch" is also something I've been meaning to do for the longest time, though no real progress there yet.

        <h2> &nbsp; Mechanical keyboards</h2>
        <p>
          Always been interested in technology, especially computer accessory related.
          <br>  
          <br> It took a handful of keyboards breaking before i decided to get something I could repair myself.
          <br> Finding something inbetween a prebuilt and fully custom one, i ended up with a hotswap, which allows you to swap certain parts without needing a soldering kit. 
        </p>
        <p>
          End of 2022 I found a new high tech keyboard that was mostly customizable, however due to the technology behind it the hardware pieces you could swap around are a bit more limited.
          <br>
          <br> Though customizable, it needs some of its original parts that are normally swappable in more custom keyboards in order to still work with the new technology.
